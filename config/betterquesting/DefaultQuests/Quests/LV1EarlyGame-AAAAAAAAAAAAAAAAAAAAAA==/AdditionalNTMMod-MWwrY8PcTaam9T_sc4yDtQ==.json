These can be enabled in the hbm.cfg file.\n\n§2Expensive Mode§r makes everything more expensive by requiring not only more resourses, but also new components. The quest book will not reflect the changes in progression if its enabled.\n\n§2528 Mode§r introduces gates in the form of templates which are unlocked by destroying a certain amount of items in an §3Annihilator§r. Additionally, some items, mainly circuits, are percentage based now to be crafted. Along with that, theres also more changes that make the game harder, such as §6Tantalum§r generating in a certain area, landmines spawning more frequently and all §dAE2§r blocks §4EXPLODE§r when used.\n\nMany recycling probabilities of the §3Precision Assembler§r are massively lowered with expensive mode enabled, increasing effective cost massively.\n\n§2Rampant Mode§r makes glyphids a very big threat as pollution now makes them way stronger and more aggresive. New more destructive types of glyphids will also become more common. If high enough pollution has been reached, glyphid scouts can spawn passively, which makes automated defense systems necessary as to prevent new hives from being created.\n\n§2For modes with recipe changes, the modpack\u0027s recipes have to be inserted again after a new hbmrecipes folder has been created and modes enabled.§r \n",
